    <h1 class="h1">Why Warmups Don’t Fix Ranked Inconsistency</h1>
    <p class="sub">
      Many competitive players warm up, aim train, or practice — yet still feel inconsistent in ranked.
      That’s because warmups improve mechanics, not execution stability under pressure.
    </p>
    <p class="hint">
      This applies across Valorant, League of Legends, CS, and Rocket League.
    </p>

      <h2 class="h2">Warmups Do Help — Just Not With This</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        Warmups are valuable. They sharpen mechanics, timing, and coordination.
        But ranked inconsistency rarely comes from mechanical unreadiness.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        Players often feel mechanically “on” and still underperform once pressure is introduced.
      </p>
      <p class="hint">
        That disconnect is the key issue.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">What Warmups Don’t Address</h2>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li>Pressure-induced hesitation</li>
        <li>Emotional reactions to mistakes</li>
        <li>Confidence drops mid-session</li>
        <li>Fatigue over multiple games</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="hint">
        These are execution stability problems, not aim problems.

    <section class="card">
      <h2 class="h2">Why Practice Feels Different From Ranked</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        Ranked environments introduce evaluation, stakes, and emotional volatility.
        Practice modes do not replicate these conditions.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        This is why players often feel consistent in practice but random in ranked.
      </p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2 class="h2">Consistency Requires an Additional Layer</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        Warmups should prepare mechanics.
        Consistency systems stabilize execution.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        Without that second layer, players remain dependent on “feeling good.”
