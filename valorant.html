    <section class="card" aria-label="Valorant ranked overview">
      <h1 class="h1">Valorant Ranked Struggles (Iron → Radiant)</h1>
      <p class="sub">
        Valorant punishes inconsistency more than almost any shooter. Utility, roles and comms make it easy
        to look like a star one day and a liability the next.
      </p>
      <p class="hint">
        Below is a practical look at what blocks players in each bracket — and why “just aim train more”
        stops working very quickly.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- IRON–SILVER -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="Iron to Silver struggles in Valorant">
      <h2 class="h2">Iron–Silver: Role Confusion and Misused Utility</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        In the lowest tiers, most mistakes come from misunderstanding what your agent is supposed to do
        and when your utility matters.
      </p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>Random ability usage:</strong> throwing smokes, walls and mollies with no timing or purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>Dual-installs:</strong> stacking conflicting agents (e.g. 3 duelists) and expecting structured rounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Audio overload:</strong> ignoring footsteps, reloads and utility sounds while chasing duels.</li>
        <li><strong>No plant/retake plan:</strong> everyone runs in, nobody decides where and how you actually hold sites.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="hint">
        To increase rank in Valorant from Iron/Silver, you don’t need Radiant tactics — you need simple,
        repeatable setups for your favorite agents.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- GOLD–PLAT -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="Gold to Platinum struggles in Valorant">
      <h2 class="h2">Gold–Platinum: Mid-Round Discipline and Trade Timing</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        Gold and Plat players often know lineups and executes, but mid-round structure collapses once the
        plan goes slightly wrong.
      </p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>No trade spacing:</strong> entering sites one by one instead of moving as a unit.</li>
        <li><strong>Over-peeking man advantage:</strong> swinging when you could just hold a crossfire and win on numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignoring ult economy:</strong> ults get used randomly instead of to break stalemates or win key rounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Emotional comms:</strong> complaining on mic instead of giving actionable information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="hint">
        The Gold–Plat climb rarely comes from raw aim upgrades; it comes from cleaner trades and fewer ego swings.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- DIAMOND–ASCENDANT -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="Diamond to Ascendant struggles in Valorant">
      <h2 class="h2">Diamond–Ascendant: Info Conversion and Pressure Management</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        At Diamond and Ascendant, most players know the maps. The separation comes from who can convert information
        into confident, fast decisions.
      </p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>Info not processed:</strong> knowing they used utility A-site then still five-manning into the stack.</li>
        <li><strong>Clutch anxiety:</strong> overthinking 1vX situations and running out of time or bullets.</li>
        <li><strong>Rank fear:</strong> playing to protect RR instead of playing to win the round.</li>
        <li><strong>Session yo-yo:</strong> having one insane game then instantly queueing three more while mentally exhausted.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="hint">
        The difference between stuck Diamond and climbing Diamond is often how you handle bad halves and clutch pressure.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- IMMORTAL–RADIANT -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="Immortal to Radiant struggles in Valorant">
      <h2 class="h2">Immortal–Radiant: Session Design &amp; Identity</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        At the top, everyone can shoot and everyone knows the maps. The issue becomes how you design your
        ranked sessions and protect your best mental state.
      </p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>Over-grinding:</strong> playing 8–10 ranked games in a row with no structure or reset.</li>
        <li><strong>Identity swapping:</strong> changing agents every few days, never letting your strengths compound.</li>
        <li><strong>Unstructured review:</strong> watching VODs without extracting concrete habits to change.</li>
        <li><strong>LP-weather mindset:</strong> confidence completely tied to short-term RR swings.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="hint">
        Radiant players protect their focus and routines as much as they protect their aim.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card" aria-label="Valorant consistency system">
      <h2 class="h2">A System for Consistent Valorant Performance</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        If you already know lineups, maps and basic teamplay, your next breakthrough probably won’t come from a new crosshair.
        It will come from stabilizing how you approach every ranked session.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        The <strong>Performance Consistency System + Goal Tracker</strong> is built to slot into Valorant:
      </p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li>Pre-game routine to avoid autopilot queueing.</li>
        <li>In-session reset protocol when a game starts going sideways.</li>
        <li>Lightweight post-game reflection that doesn’t feel like homework.</li>
      </ul>
