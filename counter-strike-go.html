    <section class="card" aria-label="Counter-Strike ranked overview">
      <h1 class="h1">Counter-Strike Ranked Struggles (Silver → Global Elite)</h1>
      <p class="sub">
        In Counter-Strike, one bad decision or mistimed peek can decide the entire round. The higher you climb,
        the less room you have for inconsistent execution — even if your raw aim is good.
      </p>
      <p class="hint">
        These are the most common patterns that keep CS players stuck at each bracket, even after hours of DM and aim maps.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SILVER / NOVA -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="Silver and Gold Nova struggles">
      <h2 class="h2">Silver–Gold Nova: Aim Without Structure</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        Early ranks are full of players who can click on heads in DM but fall apart when utility, pressure
        and communication matter.
      </p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>Raw swing habits:</strong> wide-peeking angles with no jiggle, shoulder peek or utility.</li>
        <li><strong>Utility wasteland:</strong> buying grenades but throwing them at random timings or into the wrong areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Noise control:</strong> running everywhere, giving away info, then blaming teammates for “no comms”.</li>
        <li><strong>Economy grief:</strong> full-buying when the team wants to eco, or saving with no reason.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="hint">
        To climb out of Silver/Nova, you don’t need advanced executes yet — you need basic utility discipline and
        fewer coinflip swings.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- MG / DMG -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="Master Guardian struggles">
      <h2 class="h2">Master Guardian: Mid-Round Panic &amp; No Win Condition</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        In MG ranks, players generally know the standard executes, but mid-round decision-making collapses under pressure.
      </p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>Mid-round panic:</strong> over-rotating, triple-peeking, or dry-running through smokes after losing one player.</li>
        <li><strong>No clear caller:</strong> everyone wants to “suggest” something, no one actually commits to a plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Tilt buys:</strong> forcing because of ego, not because of economy or win probability.</li>
        <li><strong>Inconsistent focus:</strong> half of your games are serious; half are played like casual deathmatch.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="hint">
        The players who climb past MG stabilize their mid-round thinking and attach decisions to clear win conditions — not feelings.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- LE / LEM -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="Legendary Eagle struggles">
      <h2 class="h2">Legendary Eagle–LEM: Information, Timing and Role Identity</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        At LE/LEM, the raw mechanics are solid. The gap is how well you use information and how reliably
        you play your role every round.
      </p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>Info not converted:</strong> you hear steps, utility and shots, but the team doesn’t turn that into a plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Timing leaks:</strong> late flanks, mistimed re-aggressions, and peeking just as your teammate looks away.</li>
        <li><strong>Role confusion:</strong> entry fraggers playing like lurkers, AWPers taking rifler angles, and vice versa.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance swings:</strong> one game you drop 30, the next game you’re invisible — same lobby quality.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="hint">
        Consistency at LE/LEM comes from playing your role the same way every game, not from finding “better crosshair placement” videos.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SUPREME / GLOBAL -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="Supreme and Global Elite struggles">
      <h2 class="h2">Supreme–Global Elite: Mental Control and Session Quality</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        At the top end, everyone has good aim and utility. What separates stable Supreme/Global players is how
        they handle bad starts, lost clutches and LP swings.
      </p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>Over-attaching to stats:</strong> chasing K/D instead of making the right sacrificial plays for the round win.</li>
        <li><strong>Session bleed:</strong> letting one bad half or one tilt game contaminate the entire play session.</li>
        <li><strong>No reset protocol:</strong> queueing instantly after a loss instead of resetting focus and intent.</li>
        <li><strong>Fear of rank loss:</strong> playing ultra passive near rank changes, which ironically leads to more losses.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="hint">
        To hold Global, you don’t need better spray transfer — you need better control over when and how you queue,
        and how you reset after bad games.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2 class="h2">Climb CS Ranks Without Living in DM</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        If you’re already practicing aim and utility, the missing piece is often a structure for your
        <strong>mental, focus and decision-making</strong> between matches.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        The <strong>Performance Consistency System + Goal Tracker</strong> gives you a practical framework you can
        apply to CS, Valorant and other tactical shooters:

      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li>Pre-game checklist to prevent autopilot queueing.</li>
        <li>In-game reset steps for when a round or half goes badly.</li>
        <li>Post-session reflection that improves your <em>next</em> queue, not just your mood.</li>
