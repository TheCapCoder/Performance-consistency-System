    <p class="sub">
      If you’re tired of playing great one session and terrible the next, the solution isn’t more games.
      Ranked consistency comes from stabilizing execution — not increasing volume.
    </p>
    <p class="hint">
      This applies across competitive games like Valorant, League of Legends, Counter-Strike, and Rocket League.

      <h2 class="h2">Why Playing More Doesn’t Fix Ranked Inconsistency</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        Many players try to fix inconsistency by grinding more ranked games.
        While this can improve mechanics, it often makes execution less stable.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        More games stack fatigue, emotional carryover, and frustration.
        Without proper resets, each match bleeds into the next — causing performance swings.
      </p>
      <p class="hint">
        This is why “just play more” rarely leads to consistent ranked performance.
      </p>

    <section class="card" aria-label="What consistency actually means">
      <h2 class="h2">What Consistency in Ranked Actually Means</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        Being consistent doesn’t mean playing perfectly every game.
        It means accessing your real skill level reliably — regardless of mood, pressure, or recent results.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        Consistent players reduce variance. They don’t rely on confidence spikes or momentum —
        they use structure to keep execution stable.
      </p>
      <p class="hint">
        Consistency is controlled execution, not emotional performance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Block 3 -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="Consistency framework overview">
      <h2 class="h2">A Simple Framework for Ranked Consistency</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        Consistent ranked performance comes from managing three phases — before, during, and between games.
      </p>

      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>Before ranked:</strong> Enter sessions mentally aligned, not scattered</li>
        <li><strong>During games:</strong> Prevent mistakes from turning into spirals</li>
        <li><strong>Between games:</strong> Reset properly so results don’t carry over</li>
        <li><strong>Across sessions:</strong> Track patterns instead of guessing</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="hint">
        This framework works regardless of rank or game.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">Turn the Framework Into a Repeatable System</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        Knowing what consistency requires is one thing.
        Applying it every ranked session is another.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        A structured system with a goal & performance tracker removes guesswork
        and helps you stabilize execution over time.
