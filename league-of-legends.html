    <!-- HERO -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="League of Legends ranked overview">
      <h1 class="h1">League of Legends Ranked Struggles (Iron → Challenger)</h1>
      <p class="sub">
        League is one of the most punishing games for inconsistency. You can be the best player in the lobby
        on one day and look completely lost the next — even with the same mechanics.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        Below is a breakdown of common ranked struggles in each bracket and what actually blocks players from
        climbing — even when they “know what to do”.
      </p>
      <p class="hint">
        This page is written for players who want a realistic guide to reaching higher ranks without living in solo queue.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- IRON – SILVER -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="Iron to Silver struggles in League of Legends">
      <h2 class="h2">Iron–Silver: Chaos, Basics and Blame</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        At the lowest ranks, games are chaotic and random. That makes it easy to believe you’re “stuck” because of bad teammates —
        but the real issue is usually unstable fundamentals.
      </p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>Wave control doesn’t exist:</strong> random shoves, perma-freezing by accident, and no plan for crash &amp; reset.</li>
        <li><strong>Coinflip fights:</strong> skirmishing on cooldown instead of playing around power spikes and numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>Item + rune mismatch:</strong> copying pro builds that don’t make sense for the lobby or your skill level.</li>
        <li><strong>No win condition:</strong> not knowing <em>who</em> should carry or how your champ actually wins the game.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="hint">
        If you’re Iron–Silver and want to increase rank in League of Legends, focus on one lane, one champion pool,
        and stabilizing early game decisions — not mechanics spam.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- GOLD – PLATINUM -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="Gold to Platinum struggles in League of Legends">
      <h2 class="h2">Gold–Platinum: Macro, Win Conditions and Consistency</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        Gold–Plat is where players “know” a lot but can’t execute it in real games. The knowledge exists in their head,
        not in their automatic decisions.
      </p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>Macro leaks:</strong> coinflip herald vs dragon, random side-lane timings, giving up waves for no reason.</li>
        <li><strong>Tempo blindness:</strong> staying on the map with low HP/mana, missing reset timings, falling behind levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Over-attached to KDA:</strong> avoiding good fights because you don’t want to die, even if it wins the game.</li>
        <li><strong>Inconsistent focus:</strong> one day you track the enemy jungler; the next day you alt-tab and autopilot.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="hint">
        The jump from Gold to high Platinum happens when you stabilize your decision-making between games,
        not when you find the “perfect” new champion.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- DIAMOND – MASTER -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="Diamond to Master struggles in League of Legends">
      <h2 class="h2">Diamond–Master: Tempo, Adaptation and Tilt</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        In Diamond and Master, most players have similar mechanics. The gap is execution under pressure and
        your ability to adapt when the game doesn’t match your plan.
      </p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>Rigid game plans:</strong> forcing a specific playstyle even when draft or lobby doesn’t support it.</li>
        <li><strong>Tempo griefs:</strong> taking one extra wave, one extra camp, one extra fight — and losing control of the map.</li>
        <li><strong>Tilt loops:</strong> one mistake leads to frustration, which leads to rushed decisions, which creates more mistakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Rank anxiety:</strong> playing “not to lose LP” instead of playing to win, especially near promos or a new peak.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="hint">
        Diamond–Master players don’t need new mechanics — they need better between-game resets and an actual
        system for managing tilt and pressure.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- GRANDMASTER – CHALLENGER -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="Guide to reaching Challenger in League of Legends">
      <h2 class="h2">Grandmaster–Challenger: Decision Quality &amp; High-Intent Practice</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        At the top, almost everyone is good. What separates Challenger from GM is not huge skill gaps — it’s
        decision quality across a <em>season</em>, not a single week.
      </p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>Game selection:</strong> playing when focused and warmed up vs queueing exhausted, tilted, or rushed.</li>
        <li><strong>Review loop:</strong> targeted review of <em>recurring mistakes</em> instead of mindless VOD watching.</li>
        <li><strong>Identity stability:</strong> knowing exactly what your champion pool does into the meta and not swapping every week.</li>
        <li><strong>Emotional control:</strong> not letting LP swings dictate your confidence and decision style.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="hint">
        A realistic guide to reaching Challenger is less about “secret tech” and more about protecting
        your decision quality session after session.

        If you recognize yourself in these ranks, you don’t need another champion guide — you need a structure
