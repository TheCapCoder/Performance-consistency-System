    <h1 class="h1">Competitive Gaming Performance Consistency</h1>
    <p class="sub">
      This site is built for competitive players who care about ranked performance —
      but struggle with inconsistency across sessions.
    </p>
    <p class="sub">
      If you play great one day and fall apart the next, the issue is rarely mechanics.
      It’s execution stability under pressure.
    </p>
    <p class="hint">
      Relevant across Valorant, League of Legends, Counter-Strike, Rocket League, and similar ranked games.

      <h2 class="h2">Why Ranked Performance Feels Random</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        Ranked environments introduce pressure, emotional carryover, and fatigue
        that dramatically change how skills are executed.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        This is why many players feel consistent in practice
        but inconsistent in ranked games.

      <h2 class="h2">What Actually Creates Consistency</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        Consistency doesn’t come from grinding more games
        or relying on confidence.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        It comes from stabilizing execution before, during,
        and between ranked matches.

      <h2 class="h2">Why Common Fixes Fall Short</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        Warmups, aim training, and practice are important —
        but they don’t address execution under pressure.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        Without a consistency layer, players remain dependent
        on “good days.”
