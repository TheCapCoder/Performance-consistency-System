      <h1 class="h1">Rocket League Ranked Struggles (Bronze → SSL)</h1>
      <p class="sub">
        Rocket League is brutal for inconsistency. Some days you feel like a mechanical god, other days you whiff
        open nets and double-commit every play.
      </p>
      <p class="hint">
        These are the most common patterns by bracket — and why “just grind more games” doesn’t fix them.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- BRONZE–SILVER -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="Bronze to Silver struggles in Rocket League">
      <h2 class="h2">Bronze–Silver: Car Control and Camera Chaos</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        Early ranks are less about “bad teammates” and more about basic control and being able to see
        what’s actually happening.
      </p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>Unstable camera settings:</strong> changing FOV, distance and angle constantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Boost addiction:</strong> chasing big pads and leaving net open for free shots.</li>
        <li><strong>No rotation concept:</strong> all three players sit in the same corner of the field.</li>
        <li><strong>Panic clears:</strong> hitting the ball anywhere instead of to a teammate or space.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="hint">
        To climb out of Bronze/Silver, stabilize camera + control settings and learn a simple “rotate 3rd man back” rule.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- GOLD–PLAT -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="Gold to Platinum struggles in Rocket League">
      <h2 class="h2">Gold–Platinum: Rotations and Decision Timing</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        Gold and Plat players usually have basic mechanics but lose games on rotations and decision speed.
      </p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>Double commits:</strong> two players going for the same ball while leaving net empty.</li>
        <li><strong>Over-challenging:</strong> diving for every 50/50 instead of shadowing or faking challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Backboard ignores:</strong> letting balls bounce off your own backboard for easy goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Chase mentality:</strong> playing for flashy touches instead of controlled, repeatable plays.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="hint">
        The Gold–Plat climb is mostly about fewer catastrophic mistakes, not “musty flicks”.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- DIAMOND–CHAMP -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="Diamond to Champion struggles in Rocket League">
      <h2 class="h2">Diamond–Champion: Consistency and Pressure</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        In Diamond and Champ, you often “know” how to play — you just don’t do it every game or every touch.
      </p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>Inconsistent touches:</strong> alternating between perfect first touches and random booms.</li>
        <li><strong>Over-extended rotations:</strong> taking greedy routes through boost that break rotation structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Momentum swings:</strong> one kickoff goal against you and the whole team collapses.</li>
        <li><strong>Rank anxiety:</strong> playing scared near division-up or promotion games.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="hint">
        Diamond–Champ players often need a better <em>mental</em> and <em>session</em> system more than a new mechanic to spam.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- GC–SSL -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="Grand Champion to Supersonic Legend struggles in Rocket League">
      <h2 class="h2">Grand Champion–SSL: Identity and Session Quality</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        At GC and SSL, everyone can hit clean mechanics. The real difference is how consistently you play your best style
        across weeks, not one good evening.
      </p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>Over-queueing:</strong> staying on even when you feel tilted or heavy, burning MMR.</li>
        <li><strong>Style confusion:</strong> swapping between ultra-mechanical “freestyling” and rigid rotation focus.</li>
        <li><strong>Low-intent games:</strong> playing while half tabbed-out, watching something, or just “killing time”.</li>
        <li><strong>No reflection loop:</strong> not tracking the specific situations where you repeatedly throw games.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="hint">
        GC→SSL is less about a new mechanic and more about protecting the quality of your queues.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card" aria-label="Rocket League consistency system">
      <h2 class="h2">Turn Rocket League Sessions into Consistent Climb</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        If your mechanics already look “good enough” for your rank, the next edge is consistency: how you warm up,
        when you queue, and how you reset after bad games.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        The <strong>Performance Consistency System + Goal Tracker</strong> gives you:
      </p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li>A pre-session checklist so you don’t queue when you’re not ready.</li>
        <li>In-session reset tools to stop tilt from ruining the next five games.</li>
        <li>Simple goal tracking that aligns your practice with your rank targets.</li>
      </ul>
