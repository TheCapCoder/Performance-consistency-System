    <h1 class="h1">Why You Play Inconsistently in Ranked Games (Even When You’re Skilled)</h1>
    <p class="sub">
      If you dominate some ranked sessions and completely fall apart in others, you’re not alone.
      Inconsistent performance is one of the most common problems in competitive games like Valorant,
      League of Legends, Counter-Strike, and Rocket League — and it’s rarely a pure mechanics issue.
    </p>
    <p class="hint">
      Players search phrases like <strong>“why am I inconsistent in ranked”</strong>,
      <strong>“why I play worse some days”</strong>, and <strong>“how to be consistent in ranked”</strong>
      because ranked pressure changes execution, not your true skill.

      <h2 class="h2">Inconsistency Usually Comes From</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        Ranked performance swings happen when your execution gets unstable under pressure. These are the most common causes:
      </p>

      <div class="grid" aria-label="Summary cards">

    <section class="card" aria-label="Real reasons ranked performance fluctuates">
      <h2 class="h2">The Real Reasons You Play Inconsistently in Ranked</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        These are the actual reasons competitive players experience inconsistent ranked performance — even when their mechanics are strong.
      </p>

      <details class="accordion">
        <summary>1) Pressure changes how your brain executes skills</summary>
        <p>
          In ranked, performance pressure can push your brain from automatic execution into conscious control.
          That often creates hesitation, slower decisions, and “choking” — not because you lack skill, but because you’re
          thinking about actions you normally execute naturally. This is a major reason players perform better in practice
          but struggle in ranked games.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="accordion">
        <summary>2) Emotional carryover between matches</summary>
        <p>
          A bad loss, a toxic teammate, or one huge mistake doesn’t automatically reset when the next game loads.
          Many players queue again while still tilted, defensive, or overly cautious. That emotional carryover stacks up
          over a session and creates sudden drops in ranked consistency.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="accordion">
        <summary>3) Overcorrection after mistakes</summary>
        <p>
          After a mistake, players often try to “fix it” by forcing a different style: too passive, too aggressive,
          over-peeking, under-peeking, second-guessing. This is overcorrection — and it breaks consistency because you’re
          no longer playing your normal game, you’re reacting emotionally to the last error.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="accordion">
        <summary>4) Cognitive fatigue during ranked sessions</summary>
        <p>
          Ranked play burns mental fuel: focus, awareness, decision-making, emotional control, and mechanics all draw from
          the same limited cognitive resources. As fatigue builds, your execution becomes unstable. That’s why many players
          start a session strong and steadily play worse across games — even if they keep “trying harder.”
        </p>
      </details>

      <p class="hint">
        If you’re searching <strong>“why I’m inconsistent in Valorant”</strong> or <strong>“why I play worse in LoL ranked”</strong>,
        the answer is usually execution stability — not raw skill.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Box 3: Why common fixes fail -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="Why common fixes fail">
      <h2 class="h2">Why Grinding, Warmups, and Aim Training Don’t Fix Inconsistency</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        The most common advice for inconsistent ranked performance is to grind more games, do more aim training,
        or warm up longer. Those things improve mechanics — but they don’t reliably stabilize execution under ranked pressure.
      </p>

      <p class="sub">
        Inconsistency is often not a mechanical problem. It’s an <strong>execution stability problem</strong>.
        Without a way to stabilize your state <em>before</em> ranked, prevent spirals <em>during</em> matches,
        and reset properly <em>between</em> games, more volume can actually make inconsistency worse by stacking fatigue and emotion.
      </p>

      <p class="hint">
        This is why players can have great practice sessions, then feel “random” in ranked: practice doesn’t reproduce the same pressure.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Box 4: System framing + CTA -->
    <section class="card" aria-label="Solution framing and next step">
      <h2 class="h2">Consistency Requires a System, Not Motivation</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        Players who perform consistently in ranked don’t rely on confidence or “feeling good.”
        They use simple structures that reduce variance and stabilize execution session-to-session.
      </p>

      <ul class="clean-list" aria-label="Consistency system components">
        <li>Stabilize your pre-session state (so you don’t enter ranked already scattered)</li>
        <li>Prevent mid-game spirals after mistakes</li>
        <li>Reset properly between matches (so emotion doesn’t carry over)</li>
        <li>Track patterns over time (so you build consistency instead of guessing)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="hint">
        If you want a structured approach built for competitive players, the next step is a repeatable system + tracker.
