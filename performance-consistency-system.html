    <p class="sub">
      A structured system for competitive ranked players who are tired of performance swings —
      playing great one day and falling apart the next.
    </p>
    <p class="sub">
      This is not coaching. It’s a repeatable framework + tracker designed to stabilize execution
      before, during, and between ranked games.

      <h2 class="h2">What This Helps You Fix</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        Inconsistent ranked performance usually isn’t a lack of skill — it’s unstable execution under pressure.
        This system is built to reduce variance and help you access your real level more reliably.
      </p>

      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li>Performance swings across days and sessions</li>
        <li>Confidence drops after mistakes</li>
        <li>Emotional carryover between matches</li>
        <li>Session decline from fatigue and tilt buildup</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="hint">
        The goal is not perfection. The goal is stable, repeatable execution.

    <section class="card" aria-label="How it works">
      <h2 class="h2">How the System Works</h2>
      <p class="sub">
        The system is designed around real ranked conditions: pressure, momentum shifts, mistakes, and short reset windows.
        It focuses on three phases of consistency:
      </p>

      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>Pre-session:</strong> enter ranked mentally aligned (not scattered)</li>
        <li><strong>In-game:</strong> prevent one mistake from becoming a spiral</li>
        <li><strong>Between games:</strong> reset properly so results don’t carry over</li>
        <li><strong>Across sessions:</strong> track patterns to reduce variance over time</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="hint">
        Simple enough to use while you play. Structured enough to create real change.
